COMPULSORY TASK 1 NOTES

"Write a note about what you found interesting about the similarities
between cat, monkey and banana and think of an example of your own."

    I found the following fact interesting... 
        Where the the Cat and Banana has a similarity of 0.22 while,
        Monkey and Banana have a 0.40 similarity. This interests me as 
        I can see that the model looking at what the animal eats
    
    A example of my own would be the similarity between...
        Windows(OS), Apple(iOS) and Linux(Debian)
        I found it very interesting that Apple and Windows only scored 0.46 while, Windows and Linux scored 0.71.
        Meaning Windows and Linux is more associated to one another than Apple and Windows.

"Run the example file with the simpler language model ‘en_core_web_sm’
and write a note on what you notice is different from the model
'en_core_web_md'."

    I found the following fact interesting...
    A warning on my output mentioning: 'UserWarning: [W007] The model you're using has no word vectors loaded...', 
    found this interesting due to the different purpose or use cases for each model.
    With the _sm model the difference is that similarities between something like the complaints will have a lesser 
    value than when using the _md model.
